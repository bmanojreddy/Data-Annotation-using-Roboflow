# Data-Annotation-using-Roboflow
✅ Completed a data annotation project using Roboflow, focused on detecting license plates in car images.

📤 The process started with uploading a dataset of vehicle images to the Roboflow platform. 
🏷️ Each image was manually annotated by drawing bounding boxes around license plates to mark them as target objects. 
📦 Once the labeling was done, the annotated dataset was exported in formats like YOLO, making it ready for training object detection models.

💡 This hands-on experience highlighted the importance of clean, structured data for building accurate and efficient computer vision models.
